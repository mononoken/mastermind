This is a game of Mastermind created with Ruby for The Odin Project curiculum.

Mastermind is a codebreaking game where one player, the codemaker, comes up with a code of (4) pegs that can be any combination of (6) colors. The other play, the codebreaker, guesses the color and placement of each peg for (12) rounds. Every round, the codemaker will provide feedback to the codebreaker. The feedback will include the number of pegs that have the correct position and color, the number of pegs that are the correct color, and the number of pegs that are completely wrong. This feedback does not tell which peg matches the feedback. That is up to the codebreaker to figure out.

This game has one human player as the codebreaker and a computer for the codemaker. The computer codemaker creates a randomly generated code.

In future iterations, the computer will be able to play the game as the codebreaker as well with the human inputting as the codemaker.
