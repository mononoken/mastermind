Fix breaking if type less or more than 4 colors.

Clarify that multiple colors can be used in instructions.

Add a quit option throughout the game.

First version of game is nearly done.

Need to prompt to replay game.

Announce master_code at end of rounds if codebreaker loses.

Then move to version 2 which incorporates a computer player.

I decided I should make the randomization process for the computer player independent of the game and then add it to the game.
